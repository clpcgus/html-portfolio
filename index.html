  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my resume! I am a web developer, UX/UI designer, and empathetic thinker that values the quality of life of users. Creating user flows that navigates a user to their goal
      in the least possible amount of clicks is my favorite aspect of web design, it's like a puzzle that can continually be approved upon. Too many times I've said to myself when
      using an app or website "This could be better if.." and I hope to create code and designs that make that statement irrelevant.</p>
